## Concept

The main idea is to have something of a CI simulation platform available, 
not just to take away the hassle of continuously integrating simulation projects 
(i.e. collect and prepare data, compile and run simulation models, collect and store results),
similar to TeamCity or Jenkins, and preferably on some distributed framework like Docker Compose, 
but also to enhance the community involved (e.g. sharing of data sources, 
code comments, scenarios, ratings, comments, etc.) 
similar to www.kaggle.com and www.stackoverflow.com.

The Smet Web concept started as an innovation project for 
Mathematical Disease Modeling at the RIVM in 2017. 
After being awarded with initial funding in January, the concept was presented 
in February to health and/or modeling specialists at a [modeling colloquium][colloquium:2017],
in March to Dutch health organisations (GGDs) at the [27th Transmissiedag][poster:2017],
and in December to the Strategic Programme of the RIVM board in a [final report][report:2017].
